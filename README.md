# SSA-ConvBiAE
time series prediction
## Abstract
Time series forecasting currently has a wide range of applications in many fields. It can help people make important decisions if they can accurately estimate the future development of events or indicators. However, modeling and accurately predicting time series with different features has become one of the most challenging applications. Therefore, we propose a novel hybrid multi-step prediction model, which is combined with singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and end-to-end model, called SSA-ConvBiAE.
